# Lightwork-Memo-Series
Radio Astronmy Citizen Scientist Memos
This is the first of a LightWork Memo series, an informal series of numbered memoranda on topics related to Citizen Science with Radio Telescopes, observations of celestial noise sources using multiple radio telescopes.

The original idea was inspired from WVURAIL/Lighwork Github repo, West Virginia University: https://github.com/WVURAIL/lightwork.
